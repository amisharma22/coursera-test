        <p>Did you know that total enrolment in higher education has been estimated to be about 37.4 million in year 2018-19 by AISHE (all India survey of higher education)? 5.28 lakh posts vacant in police forces, 6.48 lakh vacant in various central government departments and 10 lakh vacancies vacant for elementary and secondary school teachers, as per economic times, times of India and India today. so on and so forth. We have students, we have vacancies vacant, still unemployment is one of the biggest issues of our country. This gap proves lack of quality of education. Education is not merely training you for a job, but it is making a human being out of you. But apparently our system doesn’t believe so. Apart from the technical skills, real life skills are essential, even for employability- communication skills, team work, empathy and over all personality development, not only this, it doesn’t allow you only to develop them yourself. The child is kept so busy, under too much of pressure, that he/she doesn’t have time for nurturing hobbies or exploring himself. Keeping yourself sane is also an achievement. Coaching culture being very famous is the example of this. Every time I see a 6-class student wearing T shirt which says “bansalitie today IITian tomorrow” hurts me. That child is not even sure right now if he wants to be an engineer, but we are all set to send him off to IIT. At first you don’t give any time for anything, force the child into books, then in interview you need all over personality. The technical skills our system intends to focus on, is not imparted properly. Lack of proper equipment and technologies in higher education is common. More focus is on the degree, than skills. Even robots can follow orders, we need innovators and leaders. I’ll explain you by an example Several studies of publication trends have shown that India’s share in the world research output hovers around 5%. But the rate of citations — the number of times these articles are cited and used as proxy for quality — is much lower at 2-3%.The present education system is fully capable of generating youth with employability skills, not; our education system is fully capable of generating depressed, frustrated, low self-esteemed and anxious robots. Over last five years more than 40,000 students committed suicide, 1 of 4 teenagers in India suffers from depression. India is leading the world, not in employability skills but crime rate. I don’t know how my worthy opponents are brave enough to claim that we have a perfect education system.

But the rate of citations — the number of times these articles are cited and used as proxy for quality — is much lower at 2-3%. Our system majorly produces or rather tries to produce good employability skills for service sector only. This brings me to the problem of mindset. The obsession of marks, the common notion that you are intelligent if you score 95%. Which couldn’t have been more wrong. The problem is in infrastructure, the system is designed such that it manufactures only a certain job worthy people. Engineers, doctors, CA. Why aren’t music, dance, sports in as main stream as these above mentioned. Why don’t we let people do only what they are good at? Why everyone should study maths, till graduation. Give only basic of all, then let them soak in the thing they want to. We get out of school and then try to find what we want to do; shouldn’t our system be capable enough of telling that. But here we are not only judging the fish by its capacity of climbing the tree, we are forcing the fish to climb the tree and teaching different ways of doing that, rather than guiding her to swim better. Another problem in our system is we believe in spoon-feeding, in forcing the child to know what we believe what is important for the child to know, but not in bringing the best out in them.  Here is a live example of spoon feeding- reservation. Reservation in jobs is major reason behind brain drain. First of all, we are not creating skilled youth, and then few we are creating, we are encouraging them to go out of the country and work. There should be a more structured system for training of primary school teachers and more incentives must be provided to them, so that we have some best mind working with the upcoming minds, to give our nation a better foundation. When india was not india but bharat, we were celebrated for our learning. Nalanda university was the best standalone university in the world for over 800 years, without any hinderance. The old us knew better ways and yet we are not learning from our past. We had an excellent system with major focus on skills. Now we are in condition that neither we are able to attract global students, nor global faculty. Cherry on the top, students for our nation prefers going out of our country. and even we are not satisfied with the skill set we are producing.  </p>
